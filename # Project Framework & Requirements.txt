## üîß Tech Stack Overview

### Frontend
- **React** is used to build the UI.
- **Tailwind CSS** handles the styling.
- The frontend is written in **TypeScript**, running on **Node.js 18+**.

### Backend
- Built with **Python** (3.9‚Äì3.11 supported).
- It likely uses FastAPI or Flask (Microsoft‚Äôs similar samples go this route).

### Infra & Deployment
- **Bicep** is used for infrastructure-as-code.
- **Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)** handles provisioning and deployment.
- You can host it on **Azure Container Apps** (default) or **App Service**.

## üîê Azure Permissions Needed

Depending on how you‚Äôre deploying, you‚Äôll need these permissions in your Azure subscription or a resource group:

| Permission | Why It‚Äôs Needed |
|------------|-----------------|
| `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` | Assigns roles like Key Vault access |
| `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write` | Handles ARM/Bicep deployments |
| `Microsoft.App/containerApps/*` | Manages Container Apps (default host) |
| `Microsoft.Web/sites/*` | Required if you deploy to App Service |
| `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/*` | For the Azure OpenAI resource |
| `Microsoft.Search/searchServices/*` | Powers AI Search indexing |
| `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/*` | For blob storage of ingested data |
| `Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/*` | Optional ‚Äì if you enable chat history with Cosmos DB |
| `Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/*` | Stores API keys and secrets |
| `Microsoft.Monitor/*` | Needed if you want to track app usage or logs |

If you don‚Äôt have Owner or User Access Administrator roles, make sure someone grants you RBAC on the resource group you‚Äôre using.
